# MNIST-dataset-for-CNN-machine-learning-CMPT412-
This is a Matlab implementation of a Convolution Neural network (CNN) that has been trained with the MNIST dataset to recognize handwritten numbers. Some of the functionality was implemented with the help of Yasutake Furukawa in the Computer Vision (CMPT412) class at SFU
